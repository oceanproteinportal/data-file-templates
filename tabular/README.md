# Creating an Ocean Protein Portal Data Submission #

## Steps ##
1. **Format the data**
    * [Protein Spectral Count](#protein-spectral-counts)
    * Protein FASTA file
    * [Peptide Spectral Count](#peptide-spectral-counts)
2. **Contact Us @ [contact@oceanproteinportal.org](mailto:contact@oceanproteinportal.org)**
    * NOTE: [Missing Values](#missing-values)
    * NOTE: [Multi-valued Data Cells](#multi-valued-data-cells)

#### Missing Values	####
For any recommended or optional fields that are present in the tabular files, please notify us of the string which identifies a missing value for each applicable column.		

#### Multi-valued Data Cells ####
For any cell that can store multiple values, please notify us of the string which identifies the delimiter between each value.
